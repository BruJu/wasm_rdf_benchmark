# Results

This folder exposes the results of Simple Pattern Matching and Loading on my personal computer (Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS).

[See the jupyter notebook](plot.ipynb).

*Erratum: In the preprint article, the repartition bar plot (Figure 6) have a scale divided by 1024. It is corrected in this notebook.*
